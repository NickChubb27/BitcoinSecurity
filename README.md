A list of things you should be aware of to protect yourself from attackers when using a hardware wallet.

- Always set up / generate your seed yourself. If the device comes preloaded with a seed, reset the device with a new seed. Consider contacting the manufacturer and ask for a new device.
- When opening a new device, make sure the tamper resistant seal has not been tampered with.
- Before sending a bitcoin transaction to your hardware wallet, always verify the address on the hardware wallet screen itself.
- Never give your seed to anyone.
- Never type your seed into a computer. Only type it into the hardware wallet itself.
- Never put your seed remotely near the internet (cloud services, gmail drafts, etc)
- Be very careful of what browser extentions you have installed. Consider using Electrum.
- Always purchase directly from the manufacturer. Not from eBay.
- When copying and pasting bitcoin addresses on your computer, be sure that you are pasting the exact same address as you copied.
- Think. Don't panic. Before giving ANY information to anyone or downloading ANYTHING. Scammers will try to make you panic into downloading updates, or divulging your seed. Don't rush. Don't panic.
