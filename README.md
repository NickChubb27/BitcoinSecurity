# BitcoinSecurity
A list of things you should be aware of to protect yourself from attackers when using a hardware wallet.

- Always set up / generate your seed yourself. If the device comes preloaded with a seed, reset the device with a new seed.
- Before sending a bitcoin transaction to your hardware wallet, always verify the address on the hardware wallet screen itself.
- Never give your seed to anyone.
- Never put your seed remotely near the internet (cloud services, gmail drafts, etc)
